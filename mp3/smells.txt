1. This is an example of the "Duplicated Code" code smell. We can apply the "Extract Method" refactoring option to remove the repeat statements.
2. (No specific response required)
3. Since this method does not seem to belong naturally in the "Nodes" class, we can say that it probably suffers from the "non-localized plan" smell. This can be fixed by moving it to where it belongs, in this case, the "jenkins.model.Jenkins" class.
4. The code from lines 249-254 were repeated four times in a row, word for word. In this situation, it made sense to simply put those repeated blocks of code into a loop that ran four times.
